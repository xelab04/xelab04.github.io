      <h2>Hosting a Dark Web Website<br></h2>
    </div>
  </div>


  <div id="potato">
    <div class="potatoes potatoes-background wow fadeInRight give-padding animated" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.5s" style="visibility: visible;-webkit-animation-duration: 1s; -moz-animation-duration: 1s; animation-duration: 1s;-webkit-animation-delay: 0.5s; -moz-animation-delay: 0.5s; animation-delay: 0.5s;">

      <p>The dark web is much more than a place to buy illegal products and get scammed. In fact, I would go as far as to argue that the dark web is the very fundamental of free speech. While it has gained extremely bad reputation from media coverage and its portrayal in movies/series, the dark web is humanity's last bastion against any tyrannical government or world order.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h2>The Dark Web - Defender of The People<br></h2><br>
        <p>Why is that though? Well, as many people already know, the dark web exists to protect people's identities. If you have read my article on privacy and security on the internet, which I strongly recommend, then you will understand that you as an internet user are constantly under surveillance, be it from Google, your Internet Service Provider (MyT), the government or even the website you are visiting!</p><p><br></p><p>The other day, I had to send a highly sensitive email and wanted to make sure nobody was snooping in. It's then that the importance of a guarantee of privacy hit me. I mean, I have always tried to be cautious on the internet, retaining as much anonymity as practicable. But in that moment, I realised that privacy, as the public knows it, is barely scratching the surface in terms of importance.<br></p><p><br></p><p>This is why I say that there are many valid reasons for using the dark web which do not include illicit products such as laundered money, drugs, weapons, or fake ID's. The anonymity of the dark web is crucial to sustain free speech in a world where your every action, every word online can be traced back to you with ease. Applications include whistleblowing and enabling freedom of the press, especially in dictatorial countries which harshly penalise anti-government sentiment.</p><p><br></p><p>It's important for there to be a free internet, one which cannot be silenced or moderated. How can you contribute to that?<br></p><p><br></p><p><br>

        </p>
        <h2>Get Hosting<br></h2><br>
        <p>This is a really cool website where I get to write articles and blog posts. Sadly, I have yet to host it on the dark web, primarily due to the resources needed for hosting. Well, I could technically run a Raspberry Pi in my home network to host the server but that's an immense drag and I do not want to lead dark web traffic to my network - I would likely get a strongly worded call from MyT.</p><p><br></p><p>For this, we will use a practical application or tool called OnionShare. It uses the TOR Onion network to preserve your anonymity and security online, while you are hosting a website or some files on the dark web. This also means that anyone who wants to access your content must do so using the TOR browser. Maybe there will be a small tutorial on that sometime.</p><p><br></p><p>You can go directly to OnionShare's official website and follow the steps there. But since you're here for my subtle charisma, I'm still going to explain how I went about hosting a dark web website. <br></p><p><br></p><p><br>

        <h2>Non-Academic Literature</h2><br>
        <p>

        This finally brings us to non-academic literature. This sort of reading is not centered around the reader obtaining novel knowledge but more around the reader's entertainment and enjoyment. To put it simply: story books. <br><br>

        I love the saying that you have only one life. In our finite lifetime, we cannot live through all there is to live through. Instead, reading offers you the opportunity to live more lives. Each one with its own ups and downs and lessons to be learnt. But, some may wonder just how significant this effect actually is. Like, what relation does a fantastical novel about dragons and elves and trolls have to do with the real world? In my opinion, every story, no matter how far fetched it may be, is grounded in the real world. And this is because the writer is human (for now at least). And the writer will pour their humanity into their work and their real joys and sorrows and a world of experiences will weave together to form the fabric of the story. <br><br>
        And of course, this translates to the reader gaining new experiences second-hand, with medium being the story. <br><br>

        Now, everyone who knows me knows that I have a strong dislike for literature and that I am very proud of my aggregate of 6 in English Literature at O-levels. But yet I do absolutely agree that reading story books helps develop critical thinking and analytical skills. I like re-reading my books and there's a series I've read in its entirety (12 books) around 15 times. Every time I read, I pick up on small details or realise new things. This stems from reading between the lines and picking up on literary hints left by the author to further develop the image of the world. <br><br>

        Furthermore, story books helps develop your imagination and creativity for obvious reasons. It also allows the reader to see different worlds from different points of view, thus helping them open their mind and have a more "balanced" view of the world. <br><br>

        And of course. Reading helps develop vocabulary and enhances writing skills. <br><br>
        This is because of the exposure the reader gets from the books. It's fascinating to me how different authors can have such distinct and exotic writing styles. And to think that exposure to so many styles of writing means nothing is absurdity. The reader is able to learn new types of sentence structure which may be unconventional and not taught at school but which fit them. You learn new ways to write, new styles to express yourself in. And that, to me, is what writing is about. I write all these articles on a somewhat regular basis and the act of writing them is how my brain expresses itself. Think of it like clothing; everyone has a style they like, that they feel comfortable in. In the same way, I think everyone has their own style of expression and until you find your own style, you will never feel at ease with your words. ** (refer to end of article) <br><br>

        Mr Moothien, my HV teacher, said on a regular basis that (paraphrased) our thoughts are a bird trapped in a cage of our language. This means that no matter what grand thoughts you may have, you will never be able to convey them to the world if you lack the language to do so. And what a pity it is that your thoughts will never reach the ears of others. <br><br>

        </p>
        <h2>Impact on GP Skills</h2><br>
        <p>

        It was inevitable that I was going to talk about GP. Writing a well structured GP essay requires a level of fluency and mastery of language not required in O-level essays from Form 5. You need to be able to fully flesh out your thoughts and convey your ideas in a structured way or else you will score peanuts. Your grammar must be sufficiently developed so that you don't lack the words to describe something when you are sitting in the exam room. And, you cannot get this skill from bite-sized TikTok videos or Twitter posts. Not at all. You need to sit yourself down and read. Then read some more. Read until you have the power granted by words to express yourself in such a way that your thoughts will never be held back by the limitations of language. <br><br>

        And, to add, these skills mentioned for GP are not exclusive to GP. In biology, when I need to formulate answers to questions, I need to be able to express myself fully. I need to not only put my knowledge into words but put it into words which the examiner will understand and award me marks for. This isn't relegated to the sciences of course; I'm certain that subjects like Business, Travel &amp; Tourism and the like need this ease of expression just as much. <br><br>

        Thank you very much for reading. This was initially a speech I made during the last HV class of 2022, with Mr Lindsay Moothien and Mrs Linda. Thank you very much for the classes which were nothing short of memorable. <br><br>
