      <h2>Your First Time at DevCon<br></h2>

    </div>
  </div>


  <div id="potato">
    <div class="potatoes potatoes-background wow fadeInRight give-padding animated" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.5s" style="visibility: visible;-webkit-animation-duration: 1s; -moz-animation-duration: 1s; animation-duration: 1s;-webkit-animation-delay: 0.5s; -moz-animation-delay: 0.5s; animation-delay: 0.5s;">

      <h2>Intro</h2><br>
      <p>Hello! So, DevCon 2023 ended a few days ago, and I thought it would be a good time to explain DevCon to newcomers. If you haven't seen it already, my blogpost for this year's DevCon is reachable &lt;here&gt;. So, this year, I managed to convince a few of my friends from the school's coding club to attend DevCon with me, and it made me realise that, while I had my mother to guide me around the first time I attended, newcomers did not get that crucial guidance and information on how to attend the session in an "optimal" way. This is why I thought of compiling a set of tips and tricks so you can make the most of the conference!<br><br>

      </p>
      <h2>Getting Registered!<br></h2><br>
      <p>A few weeks prior to the conference, the registration link will be visible on the conference website, conference.mscc.mu. You will have to head on over there and register, filling out some basic information and all that. Then, a few days prior to the first day of the event, you can expect to receive a QR code by mail. This is what will be used at the registration desk at the venue itself.</p><p>While you have registered, you still have to "register" at the desk on the first day you're attending. Hence, when you reach the venue, first thing is to head on over to the registration desk and present your QR code. This will get you sorted out, and you'll be given your lanyard and badge. You will need to have this with you on all days you attend the conference - you don't get a new badge on the second day!<br>Important reminder: you must keep the lanyard and badge on you (and visible) at all times throughout the conference.</p><p><br></p><p>In the event that you do not receive a QR code by mail, do not worry! Just present yourself to the registration desk, tell the people manning it that you did not get the QR but that you registered; everything will be sorted from there.<br>Something else worth saying is that you can also register on the day of the event, still using the registration link on the conference's website.<br></p><p><br></p><p><br>
      </p>
      <h2>Trying to Patch the World</h2><br><br>
      <p>

      Fortunately, programmers around the world, including a Mauritian team (Cyberstorm.mu) and myself, were quick to patch the exploit, updating Log4J and the programs running the old and vulnerable version, with 13% of affected code being updated to a safe version within a week of discovering the exploit. However, this vulnerability often extends way below “surface-level” code, as a single program may depend on loads of libraries which in turn have other dependencies, forming a large tree hierarchy in which the bug may lie at any of its levels. This complicates the debugging process and, as a consequence, the Log4J exploit may take years to fully eradicate from all the world’s code. <br><br>

      </p>
      <h2>Are YOU At Risk?</h2><br><br>
      <p>
      To conclude, I’ll answer the question you probably had when you started reading this: “Am I at risk from the vulnerability, especially in Minecraft?”. The answer is a somewhat certain “No”. Through extensive patching, many (but unfortunately not all) crucial systems have been fixed due to the ransomware threat and no longer present this vulnerability. This, thankfully, includes Minecraft Java edition, with Bedrock edition not having been affected in the first place. <br><br>
