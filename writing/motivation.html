      <h2>Introduction</h2><br>
      <p>Hello! In this blogpost, I would like to answer a question I got asked quite a lot during and after my session at DevCon 2023. I was actually really nervous for the questions after my talk, worried that they would be too complex for me to answer. But, surprisingly, the most popular question was about me: how I got into tech, how I stay motivated, and how I stay sane with yaml files.<br><br>I suppose these questions came up quite a bit since, at the time of the talk, I was still a secondary level student, composing my HSC exams at the end of the year. And, given that I'm a good deal younger than mostly everyone, I was a "fascinating specimen". Jokes aside, I'm not sure why it was such a popular question. But, since you asked, I'll deliver.<br><br>First though, I find it a tad bit ironic that I'm talking about motivation since I spent the last 30 minutes procrastinating before writing this, and even now am procrastinating from my ongoing HSC exams. I guess it's a question of interest and motivation.<br><br>

      </p>
      <h2>How I Got Into Tech<br></h2><br>
      <p>Let's start with how I got into tech. It's a short but pretty funny story. My dad used to play Wolfenstein 3D, a game created by ID software around the same era as the first Doom game. Well, the game was made for older machines and, as such, he needed to use an emulator to run it. This emulator was DosBOX. I sometimes played Wolf3D in the morning, on easy mode and with cheats XD. But after playing, closing the game just went back to the terminal of DosBOX and you needed to type the command "exit" to close the emulator. That was my first experience with coding of any sort - telling the computer what to do, instead of being told by the computer to update.</p><p><br></p><p>My dad went on to show me that you can't just tell the computer "make me a cup of tea" and it will do it. Years later, I discovered Python while browsing YouTube. That was over in Grade 7 (Form 1) and I was thrilled with being able to say "hello world". That's how I got into tech. Later on, I got a Raspberry Pi, and around a year ago, my cluster. I also gained interest in AI and completed a few courses.<br><br>
      </p>
      <h2>How To Stay Motivated</h2><br>
      <p>First factor, I think, which keeps me interested and always learning is the community. From the MSCC to the coding club at school, I am surrounded by like-minded people who are eager to learn and share their knowledge. This keeps me so motivated to learn and grow, and I'm incredibly privileged to have amazing role models (cough cough DevCon squad cough cough). Additionally, by meeting all sorts of cool people in these communities broadens your horizons - you gain exposure. For example, I can go on Twitter and see what other people (who I know) are building and doing, and I can learn from that, gain inspiration, or simply discover something new. A funny story about this is that I used to think I'd always go into software development or AI... But then I met Ish Sookun and got captivated by the world of system administration and Linux.<br><br>Secondly, I think that a major playing point behind staying motivated is staying interested. While your interests fluctuate, and your amount of free time varies, you may not have the energy (either physically or mentally) to stay motivated. Saying that, I'd like to talk about my session at DevCon23: I talked about Kubernetes and SBCs. So, I talked about one thing I absolutely love - Single Board Computers, and linked it to something I find fascinating and am trying to learn - Kubernetes and Clustering. This means that, despite adversities, I always stay motivated and enthusiastic. As long as you're learning or doing something, and can link it to something you enjoy, your motivation will persist. At least, from my experience.<br><br>And while I'm at it, I should say "Go for it!" The only reason I learnt this much about Kubernetes and clustering is because I made a commitment (with a lot of support from everyone, admittedly) to talk about it at DevCon, in front of an audience of people much older and exponentially more experienced than me. So, you, whoever you are, reading this! Take the leap, make commitments, learn on the job. "it may not work for everyone" - well you'll never know until you try. Go for it, and learn. Even if it means staying awake, talking to Sandeep on Twitter because you're stressed.</p><p><br>

      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Bottom line though, everyone is motivated differently, and learns in different conditions. Everyone's different and unique after all, yada yada. I hope someone found this useful, or simply entertaining and funny to read. Till next time :D<br><br>
