      <h2>Hosting a Dark Web Website<br></h2>
    </div>
  </div>


  <div id="potato">
    <div class="potatoes potatoes-background wow fadeInRight give-padding animated animated" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.5s" style="visibility: visible;-webkit-animation-duration: 1s; -moz-animation-duration: 1s; animation-duration: 1s;-webkit-animation-delay: 0.5s; -moz-animation-delay: 0.5s; animation-delay: 0.5s;">

      <p>The dark web is much more than a place to buy illegal products and get scammed. In fact, I would go as far as to argue that the dark web is the very fundamental of free speech. While it has gained extremely bad reputation from media coverage and its portrayal in movies/series, the dark web is humanity's last bastion against any tyrannical government or world order.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h2>The Dark Web - Defender of The People<br></h2><br>
        <p>Why is that though? Well, as many people already know, the dark web exists to protect people's identities. If you have read my article on privacy and security on the internet, which I strongly recommend, then you will understand that you as an internet user are constantly under surveillance, be it from Google, your Internet Service Provider (MyT), the government or even the website you are visiting!</p><p><br></p><p>The other day, I had to send a highly sensitive email and wanted to make sure nobody was snooping in. It's then that the importance of a guarantee of privacy hit me. I mean, I have always tried to be cautious on the internet, retaining as much anonymity as practicable. But in that moment, I realised that privacy, as the public knows it, is barely scratching the surface in terms of importance.<br></p><p><br></p><p>This is why I say that there are many valid reasons for using the dark web which do not include illicit products such as laundered money, drugs, weapons, or fake ID's. The anonymity of the dark web is crucial to sustain free speech in a world where your every action, every word online can be traced back to you with ease. Applications include whistleblowing and enabling freedom of the press, especially in dictatorial countries which harshly penalise anti-government sentiment.</p><p><br></p><p>It's important for there to be a free internet, one which cannot be silenced or moderated. How can you contribute to that?<br></p><p><br></p><p><br>

        </p>
        <h2>Get Hosting<br></h2><br>
        <p>This is a really cool website where I get to write articles and blog posts. Sadly, I have yet to host it on the dark web, primarily due to the resources needed for hosting. Well, I could technically run a Raspberry Pi in my home network to host the server but that's an immense drag and I do not want to lead dark web traffic to my network - I would likely get a strongly worded call from MyT.</p><p><br></p><p>For this, we will use a practical application or tool called OnionShare. It uses the TOR Onion network to preserve your anonymity and security online, while you are hosting a website or some files on the dark web. This also means that anyone who wants to access your content must do so using the TOR browser. Maybe there will be a small tutorial on that sometime.</p><p><br></p><p>You can go directly to OnionShare's official website and follow the steps there. But since you're here for my subtle charisma, I'm still going to explain how I went about hosting a dark web website. The software used here can also be used to host files on the dark web. This is nice in the sense that someone can host anti-government documents for the world to view. Or just one person, who you do not want to be associated with, can get your files completely anonymously.<br></p><p><br></p><p><br>

        </p>
        <h2>Running your WebServer<br></h2><br>
        <p>The awesome thing about using OnionShare is that you need very little technical knowledge outside of making a website. All the complicated aspects such as firewalls, VPNs, proxy servers, and port mapping are not relevant here!</p><p><br></p><p>To get started, first head over to the OnionShare website over here: https://onionshare.org/ and download the version for your operating system. If you're a Linux user like me, then you can install OnionShare from Flatpak or Snap. On Linux Mint, it's as easy as opening the software manager and searching for OnionShare there.</p><p><br></p><p>When you launch OnionShare, you will be greeted with a small dialog box saying "Connecting to TOR network..." This means that the OnionShare software is setting up the required connections with the Onion network - the 3 transit nodes and an optional bridge node to bypass censorship. Once that's done, click on "Publish a Website". The other two functionalities are pretty interesting in their own right, but we want to have a more "noticeable" contribution.</p><p><br>

        <h2>Make Your Webpage<br></h2><br>
        <p>Have you made your webpage yet? If so, this step is not for you. However, if you haven't, let's get making one.<br>At the very core, a webpage only needs an HTML file, which must be called *index.html*. Not naming it that will lead to OnionShare not finding the homepage and will return errors. You can put whatever you want in your HTML file, and I will not go much into detail on that since tutorial websites will get you started writing HTML faster than I can make you.</p><p>Something important to note is that your website should not depend on 
JavaScript. JS is the programming language responsible for making 
websites vibrant and interactive. While it will make your website 
pretty, most TOR users disable JS from running in their browser, since 
malicious JS code built in to the browser may be compromising to them. 
Bottom line - just avoid the JS entirely.</p><p><br></p><h2>Get It Hosted</h2><div><br></div><p></p><p>Now you have all the website files, including the media - images/videos, it is straightforward to host it on the TOR network. On the bottom right of the OnionShare window is the button to add files. Make sure you add them in the same way as they are on your computer or you might end up with the webserver wondering where some assets have gone. Once it's been added, click "start sharing" and now, your website is on the dark web! The URL on the bottom (http://&lt;random-letters&gt;.onion) is the link to your dark web website. You will need TOR to access it though; a normal browser like Chrome or Firefox won't understand the onion link.</p><p><br></p><p>There are some settings you may want to change, such as disabling the password or keeping a constant URL, making it easier for whoever wants to see your site. And a small notice that your laptop/desktop is now a webserver. Turning it off means your website will be inaccessible. Anyway, I hope this short guide has been helpful or educational. Do message me on Telegram (@Anon8204) if you do host anything on the dark web.<br></p>
