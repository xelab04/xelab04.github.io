      <p>I generally agree with this sentiment, that a car-dominated infrastructure is not the way forward. It is impractical, polluting and leads to huge expanses of land being cleared so humans can move around faster and easier.<br>A small disclosure, however: I am not very knowledgeable when it comes to local infrastructure, it’s a bit of a complicated matter from my perspective.</p><p><br></p>
<p>Car-free Sundays. That would be awesome! The main road being nearly empty, the motorway practically devoid of activity and a more quiet atmosphere for those living near major roads. And with bicycles taking over as dominant means of transport? That sounds nice… What’s the catch?</p>
<p><br><br>
        </p>
        <h2>Mauritian Culture<br></h2><br>
        <p>Mauritius is wildly different from the Netherlands in many ways, especially in terms of culture. How does the typical Mauritian spend their weekend? Weekends see many excursions to Bagatelle (or Tribeca now) for shopping spree, eating out and ogling the new phones displayed in shops. During holidays, weekends may be spent going on expeditions, such as to the beach for a swim or to some of the mountains or forests for a walk. Normally, however, people may go shopping and take care of business which they did not have the time to do during the hectic work week.</p>
<p>That’s something important to consider as well! The typical Mauritian work week consists of 45 hours, which is 55% more than the Netherlands’ 29, and  22% more than England’s. Therefore, during the week, we have harrowingly little time to take care of any matters outside of our basic needs and instead push it all back to the weekend.
I bring up this point because it means people need their cars during the weekend, with Sunday being absolutely no exception. You cannot feasibly go to the supermarket on a bicycle and as for buses or the new metro…?</p>
<p><br><br>

        </p>
        <h2>Public Transport<br></h2><br>
        <p>As someone who does not intend to drive much, I am glad that the public transport sector is under much needed development, especially with the (albeit controversial) metro/tram. However, there is still some way to go.</p>
<p>As is, public transport cannot effectively replace cars, even for just a day. I am not a fan of buses, to be honest. They’re uncomfortable, unhygienic and often quite old. Furthermore, they are rarely on time and even then, they are excruciatingly slow. Add to that the fact the bus fleet is small relative to the general population. This is also the predominant opinion of the bus system here.</p><p><br></p>
<p>It means many people are repelled from taking the bus and instead categorise it as the “poor man’s means of travel”. After all, everyone who can afford to will simply drive their own car. Furthermore, the lack of specificity of buses disincentivises people from taking them, primarily due to many being allergic to walking. And I don’t blame them for that either! We have focused too much on the roads themselves and not the means of pedestrians to navigate them safely - many important roads do not even have a pavement!</p><p><br></p>
<p>Thankfully, I think this opinion may shift gradually as people learn to appreciate the public transport sector, with the shift originating from the popularity of the metro. We are also seeing more new buses on the roads too! Has anyone seen the new eco-friendly buses yet?</p>
<p><br><br>

        </p>
        <h2>Bicycles as Alternative?<br></h2><br>
        <p>I cycle all over the place. For me, it’s the best means of transport; it’s fast, not tiring, and retains the specificity of cars. However… In all seriousness, riding a bike for transport is equivalent to having a death wish. I have lost count of the number of times I nearly died on a bicycle.
Once, going round a roundabout, a bus forced the passage, despite the two lanes not being wide enough for a cyclist, a bus and another car, and pushed my handlebars such that I had to walk my bike or risk ending up under the bus’ wheels.</p><p><br></p>
<p>I also think that cycling is more dangerous that being on a motorcycle, since drivers do look out for motorcycles, with them being considerably bigger than bicycles. And even then, look at the number of accidents (and fatalities) involving motorcycles!</p><p><br></p>
<p>I do not mean to generalise, but Mauritius has an astounding number of complete donkeys on the road who cannot use their brains in a rational way whatsoever. It’s the reason we have so many accidents and deaths every year. And you mean to put a nutjob at the helm of a 1ton metal tank on the same roads as a completely unprotected cyclist? Already they can’t respect a give-way sign! Speaking of which, some crackhead in a 4x4 once nearly ran me over since he came to a rolling stop at a junction (next to Mine de Chine for those who know) and didn’t notice me.</p>
<p>My personal conclusion is that the infrastructure is already unfavourable to cyclists, and adding the bad drivers to the mix is nowhere near safe.</p><p><br></p>
<p>

        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2><br>
        <p>I think Mauritius may be able to change, but I do not see this change happening in the next 20 years, at least. Cars are sadly a deeply ingrained part of our lifestyle and all the other sectors (eg public transport) have a LOT of catching up to do if we want to get people out of cars and into buses/trams or onto bicycles. Until then, though, it would be nice if we could get drivers to respect cyclists. That is the bare minimum to be honest.</p><p><br></p>
