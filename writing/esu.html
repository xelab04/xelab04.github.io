Also, the conclusion was a lot more poignant and interesting than it currently is. I just cannot remember it for the life of me.</strong></p>
<p><br><br>
        </p><br><p>I am Alexandre Bissessur, from College du St Esprit, and I agree with this statement.</p><p><br></p>
<p>Education comes in many many forms and at different stages of our lives. Primarily, education helps a child develop into a fully functioning adult. Learning is a lifelong process which only stops when you’re dead.</p><p><br></p>
<p>I would like to draw a parallel between this topic and the honorable Pravind Jugnath’s speech to students for independence day. He emphasised heavily on how we are the foundation of the country’s economy and how we will be handed the reigns to our country in only a few years. (I don't like the speech but I needed material since one of the jury members was a politician)<br></p><p><br></p>
<p>Furthermore, globalisation plays a huge role in the importance of education. Nations are now, more than ever, open to the world. And as such, they depend on international exchange of goods and services. An educated workforce will help a country not just survive but thrive. On the other hand, a lack of education means that the country falls behind as it has nothing to offer.
Mauritius was supposed to become the fintech hub of the entire African continent but that dream is slowly fading as students nowadays are not ready for the dynamism required to keep up with the ever changing world, especially with new developments every few weeks in the tech sphere.</p>
<p><br></p><p>Finally, education is a crucial part of any democracy. Education is not all about the sciences, all the theory you learn within the 4 walls of your school. STEM is not the entirety of education. Fundamentally, education develops critical thinking skills, broadens scope. and opens minds, in addition to the theory.
A lack of education will make the population unable to think for themselves and question authority or social norms. If people are not sufficiently equipped to question the status quo, then how is any change going to happen? There can be no shift in the fabric of society if people are not educated enough to question norms.</p><p>For example, the only reason we have equal rights for women nowadays is because of education. Only through education were we, as a society, able to recognise that sexism is an abhorrent evil which has no place in the 21st century.</p>
<p><br></p><p>As such, education is the most vital aspect of any nation. A lack of education will undoubtedly cause entire countries to crumble and lead to societies unfolding.</p>
