      <h2>What is AI?<br></h2><br><br>
      <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the branch of Computer Science which deals with the simulation or emulation of human intelligence in a digital medium. Ever since the invention of the digital computer, scientists have yearned to create an "electronic brain". Alan Turing was one of the pioneers in the field of AI, shortly after the second World War, and devised the "Turing Test" which is used even today to evaluate a program's aptitude at passing as human.<br><br>

      </p>
      <h2>What is considered AI?<br></h2><br><br>
      <p>After the breakthrough that was Chat GPT, many people think that AI is exclusively a computer program that appears to think in a way not too different from humans. But, the truth is that AI has been around for much longer that the recent hype of chatbots. First, AI is anything which can replicate a degree of intelligence. This includes bots, like one which plays Tic-Tac-Toe (O/X) with you, or bots in games. All of them can pass the Turing test, that is, fool you into thinking you're playing against a human.</p><p><br></p><h2>Encountering AI.<br></h2><p></p><p><br></p><p>AI is present everywhere. Seriously. While we all know AI as Siri, Alexa, Cortana and now Chat GPT, AI has been shaping our world for a while now. We have Google Maps, which uses AI to find the optimal route from point A to point B. We have image recognition AI in self-driving cars, to understand road signs. We have AI used to predict the impact of urban development on mental well-being. Bottom line, AI has already seen widespread use in many sectors. Even medicinal! AI which can give a crude diagnosis given symptoms, and AI which can map the entire human genome to appropriately judge side effects from medicine.<br><br>
      </p>
      <h2>Kinds of AI<br></h2><br><br>
      <p>In Harvard's course on AI, several different categories of AI were shown. Those which can explore a problem, like a maze, and solve it. Those which can use knowledge and binary expressions to gain new knowledge. Those which can manipulate statistics and probabilities. Those which learn from experiences. Those which are made up of neural networks. And those which can understand and express themselves in English. Of course, you have more, such as generative AI which can create art from a few prompts.</p><p><br></p><p>The AI used for solving mazes or finding optimal paths (like G-Maps) is part of the AI syllabus. These AI are unable to learn from their experiences and are purely algorithm based. Neural networks, on the other hand, do learn from knowledge given and can adapt when they make mistakes.<br></p><p><br></p><p><br>

      </p>
      <h2>Neural Networks?<br></h2><br><br>
      <img src="assets/images/neural_net.jpeg" alt="">
      <p>I am fascinated by neural networks, they're pretty cool. Neural networks act very similarly to our own brains. Our brain has around 86 billion neurons, which is a lot. Neural networks are made up of digital neurons, which I usually call "nodes". Each node is in a sort of "mesh" structure (hence the word "network"), and arranged in layers. The first and last layers are called the input and output layers respectively. The input layer is where you enter data. It may consist of an image the AI is supposed to parse, such as a speed sign on the road. The output layer will tell you what the AI thinks the image is. All the layers in between are called hidden layers and help in the processing and the "thought process" of this artificial brain.</p><p><br></p><p>Neural networks are trained in a variety of ways.<br>- Reinforcement learning - the AI is given a task and is rewarded for completing the task. The AI will always seek to maximise the reward.<br>- Supervised learning - the AI is fed a massive dataset of labelled information. For example, road signs are labelled and given to the AI to learn.</p><p>- Unsupervised learning - the AI is left to its own devices to find patterns in data it has been given. It is then able to categorise the data.</p><p><br></p><p>When training the AI through supervised learning, the weights of each neuron are tweaked slightly based on the uncertainty of the AI and the correctness of its prediction. Weights themselves are numerical properties of a node, which are applied to the numbers input into the node.<br>For a node, with 3 inputs, of values x1,x2, and x3, there will be 3 weights, w1,w2, and w3. The output is the result of passing the sum of the weights * input into an activation function.<br></p>
      <h2><br></h2><h2>Conclusion.</h2><p><br></p><p>Well, this sums it up for the overview of AI :)</p><p>AI is an ever-evolving field with a high predicted growth in the near future. People who understand AI and its capabilities and drawbacks are also the most likely to be able to use these tools properly and effectively. I believe that AI will be a great help to those willing to embrace its super-human capabilities.<br></p></div>
